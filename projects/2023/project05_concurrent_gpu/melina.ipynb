    "In order to better represent earth´s complex climate the resolution of climate models is becoming continuously higher which improves the skill of climate and weather models forecasts. In numerical weather predictions the grid consisting of cells or points, for example an icosahedron (ICON-model) sphere, is projected on the globe to discretize and solve the governing, often differential equations, for the whole grid size (Zängel et al., 2015, Wahib 2014). Associated with the higher spatial resolution is a need for higher computing power, as it means a finer grid consisting of more cells and points for which calculations have to be done in greater detail.\n",
    "Here, high performance computing and especially Graphical Process Units (GPU´s), hardware that accellerates computing also due to the ability to process multiple tasks in parallel, are important to meet the demand for better computing performance. \n",
    "One method commonly used to solve the necessary partial differential equations in climate models are stencil motivs (Schäfer & Fey, 2011; Wahib 2014).\n",
    "Those algorithms are space and time discrete that uniformly compute the value of a specific grid point based on its own value and those of its neigbouring grid points (Schäfer & Fey, 2011).\n",
